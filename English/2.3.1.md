## The Logic

This is very easy only if you get how it works so thats why im explaining the concept.

So lets say a example you need to do 01 + 01, heres how i understand.

01 in decimal numbers is 1 so its just 1 + 1.
1 + 1 = 2 (decimal number)
then we convert 2 back to binary which is 10.

Thats the logic behind why 1+1 = 10 in binary.
